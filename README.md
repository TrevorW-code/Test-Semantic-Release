# This is a test repo to see if semantic release works

### I am excited to see if this works

And it does! This is great. I think one more thing I want to do is specify the branch in the config file so that I don't need to do a ton of renaming.
You can specify what branch in the config file setup.

Currently tested:
- feat: y
- fix: y
- refactor: n
- perf: y
- style: n
- docs: n
- build: n
- ci: n
- test: ?

I'm happy with how this is going. I kinda wonder why style tags are not shown, but that is something I can figure out tomorrow. Ciao!

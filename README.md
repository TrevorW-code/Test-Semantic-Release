# This is a test repo to see if semantic release works

### I am excited to see if this works

And it does! I think one more thing I want to do is specify the branch in the config file so that I don't need to do a ton of renaming.

I'm happy with how this is going. I kinda wonder why style tags are not shown, but that is something I can figure out tomorrow. Ciao!
